# Sovereign-T Protocol: DiscoveryNet (Version 0.0.1v)

## Introduction

The Sovereign-T Protocol is a groundbreaking blockchain initiative designed to redefine digital identity management. Built using the Cosmos SDK, it aims to provide a decentralized, secure, and scalable solution for digital identities, fostering user sovereignty and data privacy. The first version of our blockchain, 0.0.1v, is named DiscoveryNet, marking the beginning of our journey towards a more secure and interoperable digital world.

## Sovereign-T Architecture Overview

### Key Components

- **Cosmos SDK**: Utilizes the Cosmos SDK for its modular and upgradable architecture, facilitating the creation of application-specific blockchains.
- **Decentralized Oracle Network**: A network of verifiers operates similarly to Chainlink's oracle nodes, providing reliable verification services for identity attributes.
- **Prover Engine**: Fetches data from oracle nodes and sends verification data to requesting parties, ensuring accurate and timely identity verification.
- **STP Token**: The native token of the Sovereign-T Protocol, used to incentivize oracle network uptime and participation in the ecosystem.
- **Governance and Staking**: Employs a decentralized governance model, allowing token holders to vote on proposals and stake tokens as a security measure and for network participation.

### Design Principles

- **User Sovereignty**: Prioritizes user control over digital identities, allowing individuals to manage their data securely and privately.
- **Scalability**: Designed for high scalability without compromising network security or performance, accommodating the growing demands of digital identity management.
- **Interoperability**: Ensures seamless interaction with other blockchains and digital ecosystems, enhancing the utility and reach of digital identities.
- **Security**: Implements state-of-the-art cryptographic techniques to protect data and transactions, ensuring a secure environment for all users.
